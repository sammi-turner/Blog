# Learn Markdown in Two Minutes

## Just The Basics

Although [markdown](https://wordpress.com/support/markdown-quick-reference/) has a huge number of features, you're not going to need the vast majority of them.

This post will cover the just the ones I use most often.

## Headings

The heading of this post is designated with a single hash symbol.

The sub-headings of this post are designated with two hash symbols.

If I wanted, I could use three hashes, four hashes, etc to get progressively less bold titles.

Why not create a new file with the 'md' extension yourself and try that out?

## Links

See the hyperlink for "markdown" above?

I created that link by putting the word in square brackets then appending the URL in regular brackets after it.

Go on. Try it out?

## Quotes

> Mardown is fantastic, but html? Not so much.

That little gem of wisdom was designated a quote by simply putting the "greater than" symbol before that block of text.

Pretty simple, eh?

## Code

```
print("This is very easy.")
```

To designate a block of code, place a string of three back-tick symbols immediately before and after the code.

Your two minutes is up.

Go write some markdown!
