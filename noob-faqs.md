# Programming Noob FAQs

Q. What programming language should I learn?

A. When I say that the correct answer is "more than one", I am not being snarky.

Programming languages are merely tools for expressing solutions to problems that can be implemented by computers.

Learning what is common to languages A and B is instructive. So is learning the ways in which A and B are different.

Q. What programming language is good for beginners?

A. One that has a large community online. The word "community" in this context, means that totality of information about that technology online, and its entire user base.

Q. What operating system should I use for programming?

A. Although many professional programmers find Windows 10 or MacOS to be ideal for their use case, I am a strong advocate of starting your programming journey with a Linux distro instead. Not because Linux involves less work than Windows or MacOS, but because it offers more opportunities to configure your system, or fix it, WITH CODE.

Q. How long does it take to learn to code?

A. You could be writing rudimentary programs in a single afternoon. But by the same token, you will never arrive at a point where the learning stops. There is
ALWAYS more to learn.

Q. How long does it take to master a programming language?

A. Programming isn't about memorising syntax or standard library functions. Its about solving problems!

Q. What text editor or IDE should I use?

A. Try a selection of them and pick the one that you find the least confusing to begin with. Personal preference is key.

Q. I don't know what to build with code. Any suggestions?

A. Try to narrow this question down to the area of programming that interests you.

Is that web development? games? embedded systems? machine learning, a simple terminal application or something else entirely?

Once you have identified your broad area of interest, type "beginner [area of interest] projects" into your favourite search engine.

Q. I keep hearing jokes about programmers googling solutions to problems, looking up the answer and copy-pasting code from Stack Overflow. Is there any truth to this?

A. The googling never stops!

Although code is often copy-pasted, the key is figuring out the following :

1. What search terms to use.
2. Which search results are relevant to your query.
3. Which code snippets are relevant to the problem.
4. Where to put those snippets.
5. How to adapt those snippets to your specific problem.

Q. I want to use technology X, but I find its official documentation to be unreadable.

A. I feel your pain!

Even the best documentation tends to make for very dry reading. Treat it as reference material rather than a textbook. While docs are not tutorials, the best documentation often reads more like a tutorial.

For example, Arch Linux and its derivative distros have such an ardent following (myself included) because of the fantastic Arch Wiki.
