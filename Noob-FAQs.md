# Programming Noob FAQs

Q. What programming language should I learn?

A. When I say that the correct answer is "more than one", I am not being snarky.

Programming languages are merely tools for expressing solutions to problems that can be implemented by computers.

Learning what is common to languages A and B is instructive. So is learning the ways in which A and B are different.

Q. What programming language is good for beginners?

A. One that has a large community online. The word "community" in this context means that totality of information about that technology online and a
broad, active user base.

Q. What operating system should I use for programming?

A. Although many professional programmers find Windows 10 or MacOS to be ideal for their use case, I am a strong advocate of starting your programming journey with a
Linux distro instead. Not because Linux involves less work than Windows or MacOS, but because it offers more opportunities to configure your system, or fix it,
WITH CODE.

Q. How long does it take to learn to code?

A. You could be writing rudimentary programs in a single afternoon. But by the same token, you will never arrive at a point where the learning stops. There is
ALWAYS more to learn.

Q. How long does it take to master a programming language?

A. Programming isn't about memorising syntax. Its about solving problems!

Q. What text editor or IDE should I use?

A. Try a selection of them and pick the one that you find the least confusing to begin with. Personal preference is key.

Q. I don't know what to build. Any suggestions?

A. Try to narrow this question down to the area of programming that interests you.

Is that web development? games? embedded systems? machine learning, a simple terminal application or something else entirely?

Once you have identified your broad area of interest, type "beginner [area of interest] projects" into your favourite search engine.
