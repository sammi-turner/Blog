# Blog

The markdown files in this repo are all linked in the "blog" section of my personal website.

## Message In A Bottle

Given that my personal site is not server-side rendered, it will be practically invisible to Google. However, my personal site is linked from my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, so the number of readers might be non-zero? I have no idea :)

## No comments section?

Nope. There is no comments section.

But if you would like to fix a typo, correct something inaccurate that I wrote, or would like to expand on what I have written, then by all means, send me a pull request here on GitHub.

To make contact with me, you can reach me via LinkedIn or use the "contact" page on my website.
