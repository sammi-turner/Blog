# Blog

Why aren't more people blogging in markdown, right here on GitHub?

* Writing [markdown](https://wordpress.com/support/markdown-quick-reference/) is fun.

* Wrestling with a blogging platform's built-in UI is no fun. Especially when you don't have to.

* Static Site Generators (SSGs) that use markdown files as input only exist to reach non-technical audiences. So why use them for a technical blog?

* If there is something in a post that needs correcting or extending, then you are free to submit a pull request.
